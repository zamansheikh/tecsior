    summary: "A nine-month replatform of a 12-year-old monolith onto event-driven Kotlin services, completed with zero customer-visible downtime.",
    body:
      "Helix Bank's core banking system processed $1.2B in daily settlement traffic on a Java monolith first shipped in 2013. Every release required a six-hour maintenance window, and new market expansions were being blocked on the platform's inability to handle multi-currency reconciliation in real time.\n\n" +
      "We embedded a squad of six — two staff engineers, an SRE, a domain modeller, and two product designers — alongside Helix's existing platform team. The first month was discovery: shadowing operations, mapping every event a transaction touched, and stress-testing the assumptions baked into the original schema.\n\n" +
      "From month two we built outward from the most-painful boundary (the settlement engine) into event-driven Kotlin services running on Kubernetes with Kafka as the spine. Each new service launched behind a feature flag, with the monolith kept as the source of truth until parity was proven by a 30-day shadow-run.\n\n" +
      "Outcome: P99 latency on settlement fell 68%, the team now ships to production five times a week, and Helix expanded into three new currencies in the quarter following cutover — the first market expansion in four years that didn't require a platform freeze.",

    body:
      "Verde Health was running three different patient portals across their acquired clinics — none of them HIPAA-compliant in the way the 2024 audit cycle required. The remediation work alone would have taken eighteen months. They asked us to ship a replacement instead.\n\n" +
      "We delivered an end-to-end telemedicine platform in seven months: patient onboarding, video consultation, clinician handoff, prescription writing, and post-visit charting — all flowing through a single record. Encryption is end-to-end at the application layer (so even our infrastructure operators can't read consultation notes), and every action against a patient record is signed and logged.\n\n" +
      "The clinician UI was designed in close partnership with the medical staff: every screen tested against the rule that a senior doctor under load should never need more than two clicks to reach the next patient.\n\n" +
      "At rollout 14M patient records migrated from the legacy portals over a single weekend. Compliance signed off without conditions; clinician NPS on the new tool sits at +71.",

      "Atlas operates 18,000 commercial vehicles across 24 countries, but the legacy GPS provider had a 4-minute median latency between sensor reading and dashboard pixel. For perishable cargo and just-in-time deliveries that's a half-day's worth of preventable spoilage every week.\n\n" +
      "We built a streaming pipeline on top of MQTT and Apache Flink that brought median latency to 800ms and tail latency under five seconds — across every region with reliable cellular coverage. The dashboard was rewritten as a real-time map with vehicle, route, and cargo telemetry layered on demand.\n\n" +

Their existing 24-hour generation forecast — used to bid into day-ahead energy markets — sat at 11% mean absolute error. Every percentage point of that error cost real money in over- and under-procured backup capacity.\n\n" +

    category: "Engineering", status: "Published", views: 12480,
    excerpt: "Fourteen production RAG systems later, the bugs that surprised us most weren't in the retrieval — they were in the eval layer we kept telling ourselves we'd fix later.",
    body:
      "We have shipped 14 retrieval-augmented generation systems to production over the last two years — different domains, different scales, different models. The patterns we keep tripping over have very little to do with retrieval quality.\n\n" +
      "The eval problem. Every team starts with 'we'll add evals later'. Every team eventually has a Slack thread three weeks before launch arguing about whether a hallucination is a regression. We now refuse to ship a RAG system without a labelled eval set on day one. It's the cheapest insurance we know.\n\n" +
      "Context-window economics. The reflex 'just put more in context' has cost more than one client real money. Above 8k tokens, recall starts to degrade on most models — and your bill grows linearly. A reranker is almost always cheaper than a bigger window.\n\n" +
      "The retrieval bug that wasn't. Three of our last five 'retrieval bugs' turned out to be chunking bugs in disguise. If your documents have semantic boundaries (sections, FAQ items, function definitions), align your chunks to them. Sliding-window chunking is fine for prose, terrible for structured text.",

    excerpt: "HIPAA compliance is usually treated as a checklist. We treated it as a design constraint and it changed every screen.",
    body:
      "When we started on the Verde Health telemedicine platform, every conversation about HIPAA was about audit logs and at-rest encryption. Those matter, but they aren't what patients see. What patients see is the moment a clinician asks them to share something personal — and the platform has to either earn or break trust in that moment.\n\n" +
      "Three rules we wrote down early and kept referring to:\n\n" +
      "1. Show what's being recorded, while it's being recorded. A small persistent indicator wins over a one-time consent screen every time.\n\n" +
      "2. Make 'delete' really delete — and say so. The legal team flinched at the first draft. We pushed back. The button now reads 'Delete this visit permanently' and it does what it says.\n\n" +
      "3. Never bury who can see what. On every patient record there's a single line listing exactly which roles can read the page. It's not a popup, it's not a tooltip. It's right there at the top.\n\n" +
      "None of these are 'compliance' in the audit sense. All of them moved clinician NPS up.",

      "Every engagement we run ships a measurable thing every four working days. Monday is scoping. Tuesday and Wednesday are build. Thursday morning is integration. Thursday afternoon is the demo with the client. Friday morning is the retro. Friday afternoon is rest.\n\n" +
      "Why four and not two-week sprints? Two reasons. First, it forces small slices — anything that doesn't fit in four days has to be cut. That's a healthy pressure. Second, the cadence is short enough that a stalled engagement becomes visible inside one cycle instead of three.\n\n" +

    excerpt: "We tried four off-the-shelf eval frameworks before building our own. The one we kept does three things — none of them flashy.",
    body:
      "Off-the-shelf eval frameworks have a recurring problem: they're built around generic benchmarks. We needed something built around our clients' definition of correctness, which is rarely 'matches a reference answer'.\n\n" +
      "What our harness does:\n\n" +
      "1. Stores eval cases as plain markdown files in the repo, with the expected behaviour as a paragraph not a string. A judge model (a separate prompt, frozen) decides pass/fail.\n\n" +
      "2. Runs nightly against main and posts a diff to Slack. If a metric drops more than 2%, the PR that caused it gets flagged.\n\n" +
      "3. Lets a domain expert mark a case as 'still failing but it's OK now' — with a written justification stored next to the case. The team can't grade their own homework, but they can document a decision.\n\n" +

      "We've optimised the first two weeks of every engagement until they barely look like a setup phase.\n\n" +

      "Day 3: the squad has shadowed one production incident or one customer support call. This is non-negotiable. You can't help build a system you've only seen on slides.\n\n" +
